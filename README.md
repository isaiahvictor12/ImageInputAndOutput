# ImageInputAndOutput
Created using Visual Stuidio 2022.
When it is run it will output 3 .raw files: one with reversed intensity, one with 20 added to each pixel, and one with 100 added to each pixel.
I took these 3 images and converted them to .jpg using Photoshop.
These images can also be viewed here https://cs.iupui.edu/~ikvictor/ImageInputAndOutput.html.
All of the code is in Source.cpp
